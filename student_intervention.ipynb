    "Answer: I picked Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and AdaBoost (one of the Ensemble methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "1) Real world application - Could be used for disease diagnosis - based on certain symptoms, could branch out into various possible diagnoses. For instance, a runny nose could be indicative of a cold or a flu, so you could continue down branches that possibly lead to those diagnoses, but a runny nose is probably not indicative of a skin infection. Got this idea from http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html, which actually lists a ton of great real world uses. \n",
    "2) Strengths - Fairly easy to understand and does not take a lot of data prepping. Decision trees can also use both categorical or numerical data (such as splitting runny nose above). They also have fairly strong performance on large datasets.\n",
    "3) Weaknesses - Can overfit due to over-complicated trees. In other words, it might look great on the training data but not on the test set. This actually ends up happening below, as the training sets come out perfect while it is one of the lower test scores.\n",
    "4) Candidacy - Although we actually ended up processing the data above to be numerical, the data fits to decision trees in a fairly straightforward way, and I can think in my head exactly how it might be setting itself up behind the scenes. So part of it is being able to know exactly how it is going to look at the data - for instance, I bet the tree is going to split on whether someone has failed a class before.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "1) Real world application - I looked a little at this website: http://www.clopinet.com/SVM.applications.html, but other than the ones listed, I also think that using SVMs in stock price analysis would be useful. SVMs can handle multiple features fairly easily, so I think putting in multiple things such as P/E ratio, revenue growth, analyst opinions (average positivity), and even odd ones like social media buzz (on a range of 1-100 perhaps) could arrive at a decent model of where the stock price is going to move.\n",
    "2) Strengths - Good at attempting to minimize error while maximizing the margin (i.e. finding the classification separation where most of the points are the most separate with least errors), and also good with multiple dimensions.\n",
    "3) Weaknesses - Speed and size - can be a little slow depending on the data set, as well as eating up a decent amount of memory for larger tasks.\n",
    "4) Candidacy - One of the main items I remembered from the lecture videos was that SVMs did well with multiple dimensions. Due to the decent amount of features in the data set, I think this part of SVMs (good with multi-dimensionality) should do well with this data (and it does!).\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost:\n",
    "1) Real world application - Viola-Jones Face Detection (as mentioned here: http://mccormickml.com/2013/12/13/adaboost-tutorial/). Face detection is really big right now, especially with social media companies - Facebook uses it to detect who is in photos posted, and Snapchat uses it to map various filters to your face.\n",
    "2) Strengths - By going back and weighting on the errors it made to try to get closer to the one it previously got wrong (and placing less weight on what it got right), this algorithm specifically targets what it is getting wrong and tries to improve. Then, it averages itself over a number of rounds. In theory, averaging multiple rounds of this is going to be very accurate.\n",
    "3) Weaknesses - A problem can arrive in the strength above in that it can also cause overfitting when it weights toward the ones it was previously getting wrong. Also, needs an underlying algorithm that can use weighting. \n",
    "4) Candidacy - From the lecture videos, they seemed to put a high emphasis on how effective boosting can be, which is why I chose it. I actually figured that boosting with SVMs would work really well, while boosting with Decision Trees was probably less likely to work well, but the default is to use Decision Trees (done below). Although I ended up going with SVM at the end of this project due to speed, I played around with a tuned Adaboost over multiple algorithms, and SVM was the one the tuner chose, fairly in line with my expectation."

First of all, it performed extremely well regardless of training test size (~6% better at only 100 training points), and continues to be the best up to the 300 training point size. It has higher training and prediction time than the tree, but the tree just doesn't perform near as well due to constant overfitting (evidenced by the decision tree perfecting the training set each time, while never hitting 80% on the test set). Also, it is faster than Adaboost (especially in training) while still ending up slightly better even at the 300 training set size."

The margin is based on where the boundaries of the classes get set (which the algorithm moves to maximize this margin). These boundaries are based on the algorithm looking at a subset of points around a given point for similarity; these points in the subset are the \"support vectors\". This helps to cut down on the processing time in predictions. These support vectors are weighted when we train the algorithm to be more or less important, to help further refine the accuracy. \n",
